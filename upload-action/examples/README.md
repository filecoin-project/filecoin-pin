```

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Recommended: Two-Workflow Pattern

**Copy the files:**
```bash
cp examples/two-workflow-pattern/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

**Customize:**
1. Add `FILECOIN_WALLET_KEY` secret in your repository settings
2. Update build steps in `build.yml` for your project
3. Adjust `minStorageDays` and `filecoinPayBalanceLimit` in `upload-to-filecoin.yml`

**Done!** Open a PR to see it in action.

**Why this two-workflow approach?**
The recommended pattern is a **two-workflow approach**:
1. **Build workflow** (untrusted) - Builds your content, publishes artifacts.  This workflow never sees wallet secrets.
2. **Upload workflow** (trusted) - Downloads artifacts, creates IPFS CAR, uploads to Filecoin with secrets.  This upload workflow runs from the `main` branch, meaning PR branches can't modify hardcoded limits until merged. 

Note: this approach supports **same-repo PRs only**.  Fork PR support is disabled for security.

### Alternative: Single-Workflow Pattern

⚠️ **Only for trusted repositories** where all contributors have write access.

```bash
cp examples/single-workflow/build-and-upload.yml .github/workflows/
```

Then add the `FILECOIN_WALLET_KEY` secret and customize the build steps.

## 🔍 What Each File Does

**Two-Workflow Pattern:**
- `build.yml` - Runs on every PR, builds your project, uploads artifacts (no secrets)
- `upload-to-filecoin.yml` - Runs after build succeeds, downloads artifacts, uploads to Filecoin (has secrets)

**Single-Workflow Pattern:**
- `build-and-upload.yml` - Does everything in one job (build + upload)
