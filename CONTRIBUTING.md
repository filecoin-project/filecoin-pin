# Contributing to filecoin-pin

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines when submitting changes.

## Use Conventional Commits

All commits, especially PR titles, should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions or changes
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes

Example: `feat: add support for batch uploads`

## Reference GitHub Issues

Always reference the related GitHub issue in your PR description using keywords like `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`.

### Include Visual Evidence

For user-facing changes or CLI flows, include:
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Terminal output for CLI commands
- Before/after comparisons when relevant

## Draft PRs

Leave your PR in draft status until it's ready for maintainer review. This helps maintainers prioritize their time.

## Code Quality

Keep comments concise and favor self-documenting code when possible. Use clear variable names, function names, and code structure to make your intent obvious.
