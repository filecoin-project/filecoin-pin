# Filecoin Pin

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/filecoin-pin.svg?style=flat&data=n,v)](https://nodei.co/npm/filecoin-pin/)

**Store IPFS content on Filecoin's decentralized storage network with verifiable persistence.**

## Status

**⚠️ Not ready yet for production** - At least as of 2025-10-15, Filecoin Pin runs on Filecoin Calibration testnet only.  It's not ready for production use yet.

Register for updates and a later 2025 Q4 GA announcement at [filecoin.cloud](https://filecoin.cloud/).

## What is Filecoin Pin?

Filecoin Pin is a fully decentralized persistence layer for IPFS content using the global network of Filecoin storage providers with cryptographic guarantees.

When you use Filecoin Pin, your IPFS data gains:

- **Verifiable persistence** - Storage providers must cryptographically prove daily that they continue to store and serve your data
- **Economic incentives** - You only pay when storage proofs are successfully delivered and verified onchain
- **Decentralized infrastructure** - Your data can be stored across a global network of independent storage providers
- **Seamless IPFS integration** - Continue using standard [IPFS Mainnet](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#mainnet) tooling (e.g., Kubo, Helia, HTTP Gateways) while gaining Filecoin's persistence guarantees
- **Sovereign data** - Choose your providers, audit storage proofs and payments onchain, with no dependency on a single company

## Who is Filecoin Pin for?

Filecoin Pin is designed for **developers building on IPFS** who need trustless, economically-incentivized persistence for their content. Whether you're building dApps, CI/CD workflows, static websites, AI agents, or other applications, Filecoin Pin provides the missing persistence layer for IPFS.

## Affordances

Filecoin Pin offers multiple affordances to integrate Filecoin storage into your workflow:

### CLI
Upload IPFS files directly to Filecoin via the command line. Perfect for developers who want to integrate Filecoin storage into scripts, workflows, or local development environments.

- **Repository**: This repo ([filecoin-project/filecoin-pin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin))
- **Documentation**: 
  - Run `filecoin-pin --help` to see all available commands and options.
  - [CLI Walkthrough](https://docs.filecoin.io/builder-cookbook/filecoin-pin/filecoin-pin-cli)
- **Installation**: `npm install -g filecoin-pin`

### GitHub Action
Automatically publish websites or build artifacts to IPFS and Filecoin as part of your CI/CD pipeline. Ideal for static websites, documentation sites, and automated deployment workflows.

- **Repository**: This repo ([see upload-action/](./upload-action))
- **Documentation**: 
   - [GitHub Action Walkthrough](https://docs.filecoin.io/builder-cookbook/filecoin-pin/github-action)
- **Example in Production**: [filecoin-pin-website CI pipeline](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin-website/tree/main/.github/workflows)

### JavaScript "core" Library
Opinionated JavaScript library with utilities for common functionality across different use cases. Use these modules directly in your Node.js or browser applications.

- **Repository**: This repo (see [`src/core/`](./src/core) and package exports).
- **Installation**: `npm install filecoin-pin`
- **Exports**: Core modules for CAR files, payments, Synapse SDK integration, uploads, and UnixFS operations

### IPFS Pinning Server (Daemon Mode)
Run a localhost IPFS Pinning Service API server that implements the [IPFS Pinning Service API specification](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/). This allows you to use standard IPFS tooling (like `ipfs pin remote`) while storing data on Filecoin.

- **Repository**: This repo (`filecoin-pin server` command in CLI)
- **Usage**: `PRIVATE_KEY=0x... npx filecoin-pin server`
- **Status**: Works and is tested, but hasn't received as many features as the CLI.  If it would benefit your usecase, please comment on [tracking issue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin/issues/46) so we can be better informed when it comes to prioritizing.  

### Management Console GUI
Web-based management console for monitoring and managing your Filecoin Pin deployments.  This is effectively a Web UI equivalent to the [CLI](#cli).

- **Status**: Planned
- **Tracking**: See [issue #74](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin/issues/74) for updates.  Please leave a comment about your usecase if this would be particularly beneficial.

## Architecture

### The Big Picture

Filecoin Pin bridges IPFS and Filecoin to provide verifiable persistence for content-addressed data:

### Filecoin Pin Structure

This repository contains multiple affordances for user interaction and a shared library for consistent functionality:

![Filecoin Pin Structure](documentation/assets/structure.svg)

The [Synapse SDK](https://synapse.filecoin.services/) is the main library, as it's doing the work of interfacing with the rest of [Filecoin Onchain Cloud](https://filecoin.cloud) including smart contracts, Filecoin Storage Providers, and more.

[Helia](https://helia.io/) is leveraged for turning files and directories into IPFS compatible data, which we output in [CAR format](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1/).

The affordances were [discussed more above](#affordances).  All affordances use the same core library, ensuring consistent behavior and making it easy to add new interfaces in the future.

## Quick Start

## Configuration

Configuration of the Filecoin Pin CLI can be performed either with arguments, or environment variables.

The Pinning Server requires the use of environment variables, as detailed below.

### Common CLI Arguments

* `-h`, `--help`: Display help information for each command
* `-v`, `--version`: Output the version number
* `--private-key`: Ethereum-style (`0x`) private key, funded with USDFC (required)
* `--rpc-url`: Filecoin RPC endpoint (default: Calibration testnet)

Other arguments are possible for individual commands, use `--help` to find out more.

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...              # Ethereum private key with USDFC tokens

# Optional
RPC_URL=wss://...              # Filecoin RPC endpoint (default: Calibration testnet)
FILECOIN_PIN_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=https://...  # Override telemetry endpoint for testing

# Optional for Pinning Server Daemon
PORT=3456                      # Daemon server port
HOST=localhost                 # Daemon server host
DATABASE_PATH=./pins.db        # SQLite database location
CAR_STORAGE_PATH=./cars        # CAR file storage directory
LOG_LEVEL=info                 # Logging verbosity (info, debug, error)
```

### Default Data Directories

When `DATABASE_PATH` and `CAR_STORAGE_PATH` are not specified, data is stored in platform-specific locations:
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/filecoin-pin/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/filecoin-pin/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/filecoin-pin/`

## Development

Want to contribute to Filecoin Pin or run it locally?

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin
cd filecoin-pin
npm install

# Run the Pinning Server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Compile TypeScript source
npm run build

# Run the cli
# This is the equivalent of running `filecoin-pin` if you had it installed globally (e.g., `npm install filecoin-pin -g`).
# It's like doing `npx filecoin-pin` that isn't stuck on that version until you `run npm install filecoin-pin -g` again.
node ./dist/cli.js
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test             # All tests
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Integration tests
npm run lint:fix         # Fix formatting
```

## Privacy and Telemetry

Filecoin Pin collects minimal anonymous usage data to help us understand adoption and improve the tool.

### What We Collect

On the first run of the CLI, we collect:
- **Anonymous identifier**: A randomly generated UUID (not linked to any personal information)
- **Package version**: The version of filecoin-pin you're using
- **Platform**: Your operating system (e.g., darwin, linux, win32)
- **Timestamp**: When the CLI was first run

### What We Don't Collect

- No personally identifiable information
- No file names, contents, or CIDs
- No wallet addresses or private keys
- No command arguments or flags
- No network or provider information

### How to Opt Out

**Recommended:** Use the `--private` flag to permanently disable telemetry:

```bash
filecoin-pin --private
```

This creates a config file at `~/.filecoin-pin/config.json` that persists your privacy preference. All future runs will respect this setting.

**Alternative:** Set an environment variable:

```bash
export FILECOIN_PIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt
```

Or add it to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
echo 'export FILECOIN_PIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Data Usage

Telemetry data is used solely to:
- Measure unique installations and active usage
- Understand which versions are in use
- Inform development priorities and platform support

The data is collected once on first run and helps us demonstrate real-world adoption to stakeholders and contributors.

### Industry Standard Practice

This telemetry approach follows common npm ecosystem practices:
- **npm itself** collects anonymous usage data during package installation ([npm Privacy Policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/privacy/))
- Similar to [@nuxt/telemetry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxt/telemetry), [@ibm/telemetry-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm/telemetry-js), and other community packages
- All data is anonymized and used solely for measuring adoption and improving the tool
- Easy opt-out mechanism follows ecosystem conventions
